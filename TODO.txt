TODO:
	- finish messing around with difficulty buttons
	- fix the elements so that when we resize it doesn't cause a problem (maybe have a min size property)

	- Implement the ability to erase a number:
    	Add a button or action to erase the content of the selected cell.
    	Decrement the mistake count if the erased move was previously counted as a mistake.

	- Implement the ability to undo:
	    Track the history of the player's moves (insertions).
	    Create a function to undo the last move.
	    Update the mistake count accordingly when undoing moves.

	- Colorize the latest input in red:
	    When a player makes an input, track the latest input's position.
	    Create a function to colorize a specific button (cell) based on its position.
