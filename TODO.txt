TODO:
	- Different colours between generated numbers and input numbers

	- Implement the ability to erase a number:
    		Add a button or action to erase the content of the selected cell.
	    	Decrement the mistake count if the erased move was previously counted as a mistake.

	- Implement the ability to undo:
	    Track the history of the player's moves (insertions).
	    Create a function to undo the last move.
	    Update the mistake count accordingly when undoing moves.

	- Colorise the latest input in red:
	    When a player makes an input, track the latest input's position.
	    Create a function to colorise a specific button (cell) based on its position.

  	- On New Game button (the one on the right): Ask the user if he's sure about it.
		good for optimising too (gets rid of repetitive clicks)

	- When highlighting/Focusing same number, check if we click the same carreau/number for 		optimisation.	


	- Inserted value should get focus if correct input
